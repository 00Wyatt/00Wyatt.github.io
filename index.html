                        <p>This project was as part of a unit I completed at North Metropolitan TAFE, and involved
                            researching and applying a modern web technology trend. I chose Meteor.js as a framework
                            that I would investigate, learn how to use, and demonstrate it by creating an application.
                        </p>
                        <P>Meteor is an open-source, isomorphic, full-stack JavaScript platform used to build modern
                            web, desktop, and mobile applications. On the frontend it can be used with any UI library
                            such as React or Vue and the backend, Meteor uses Node with MongoDB being integrated as the
                            default database.</P>
                        <p>During this project, I have practiced skills in identifying an emerging web technology,
                            implementing a new web technology, and reviewing and finalising the implementation process.
                            I have also developed skills in server-side programming using JavaScript, and the basics of
                            using React as a UI library with TailwindCSS for styling.</p>
                        <p>This application includes an authentication system where users can register and login to
                            their accounts, and a tasks component where users can create a list and check off tasks as
                            they are completed.</p>

                        <p>This project involves creating an online cataloguing application for LEGO collections,
                            and is currently being completed at North Metropolitan TAFE. The client involved, needs
                            a solution to keep track of his LEGO sets in a digital format, and wants to display his
                            collection online.</p>
                        <P>I have been involved in all aspects of this project, from the initial discussions with
                            the client, to planning and design, and now creating a prototype of the website. Our team
                            has just completed the first half of our development plan; next semester we will be
                            creating a fully functioning web application including a database and authentication
                            system.</P>
                        <p>This prototype was built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, and the initial mock-ups were
                            designed using Figma.</p>
                        <p>I have gained experience throughout this process in areas such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implementing a structured approach to development using agile techniques</li>
                            <li>Liaising with a client and maintaining frequent progress updates</li>
                            <li>Conceptualizing and developing ideas based on a client’s needs</li>
                            <li>Documenting and outlining an agreement of the scope of a project</li>
                            <li>Developing wireframes, mock-ups, and a prototype from an original design</li>
                            <li>Leading and facilitating a team</li>

                        <p>Alongside my studies at TAFE, I have been practicing front end development using a variety of
                            online resources including a website called Frontend Mentor. The purpose of this site is to
                            give developers practice in creating webpages based on pre-made designs.</p>
                        <P>Frontend Mentor offers a range of projects that can be completed using any technology the
                            user would like to practice. I have been solidifying my understanding of HTML, CSS, and
                            JavaScript, as well as using TailwindCSS.</P>
                        <p>Through these challenges, I have primarily developed my CSS skills, including applying different
                            layout techniques with both CSS Grid and Flexbox, and structured styling using the BEM
                            methodology.</p>
                        <p>Links to these projects and live sites can be found on my Frontend Mentor profile page, and
                            other repositories that I have been working on in TAFE, and outside of it, can be found on
                            my GitHub.</p>

                    <p>I began my coding journey with the goal of starting a new career, having previously been studying
                        and working in the music industry. I started out as self-taught using a mix of free and paid
                        online resources to learn web development. Halfway through 2022 I enrolled into a Diploma of
                        Information Technology in Front End Development at North Metropolitan TAFE.</p>
                    <p>I have since expanded my coding skills and gained valuable knowledge in many other areas
                        including liaising with clients, managing and delivering projects, and working within a team. I
                        am currently seeking an opportunity to use my abilities to contribute to an organisation and
                        develop further in a professional environment.</p>

                    <p>When I’m not writing code, I usually enjoy getting outdoors with my camera, and I’m either hiking
                        in summer, or snowboarding in winter. I have a passion for learning new things and avidly read
                        as widely as I can.</p>
