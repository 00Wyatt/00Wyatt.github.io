# My Portfolio Website

This is the repository for my portfolio website at [wyattchannings.com](https://wyattchannings.com/). Featured on the site are projects that I have completed during my Diploma of Information Technology at North Metropolitan TAFE, as well as other code that I have written outside of it.

There is a bio section that includes my skills in web development, and a contact form for anyone that would like to reach out to me.

The entire website was designed and built from scratch by me, using HTML, vanilla CSS and JavaScript.
